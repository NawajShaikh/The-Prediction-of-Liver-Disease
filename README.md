# The-Prediction-of-Liver-Disease
Aim of this project is to build a best model to predict liver disease and use that model for human being to avoid risk of health, money and to give better health. In that i worked on near about 8 machine learning methods namely  Logistic Regression Naive Bayes Classifier Random Forest Decision Tree K-Nearest Neighbors Support Vector Machine Artificial Neural Network Bagging and Boosting by using R-Studio This was the first Real life project in my life in that i have learned so many things like how to find out errors and how to deal with it, Data Pre-processing part, Data Visualization, Model Building, etc.
